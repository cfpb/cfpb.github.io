title: Introducing CFPB Open Tech
author:

Welcome to **CFPB Open Tech**, the new home on the web for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to share and
discuss the work we do with technology to improve the financial lives of the consumers throughout the country.

At the CFPB, we value [openness and transparency](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/open/). Additionally, one of our
[core values](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/strategic-plan/#overview-we-aim) is innovation â€“ "Our organization
embraces new ideas and technology. We are focused on continuously improving, learning, and pushing ourselves to be
great." A natural result is that we are strong proponents of open source software, both using it in our
organization and releasing software we build. You can see more details about our philosophy on using and releasing
open source software by reading our
[Source Code Policy](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/).

Along with software development, this website will also feature the CFPB's design work, which is led by a team of
close to two dozen graphic and user experience designers. We'll talk about our design process and the value of
design in helping American consumers to understand the risks and benefits of their financial choices. Too often,
financial products, services, contracts, and terms are unfamiliar and confusing. Good design can help consumers
make the right choices for themselves and their families.

The CFPB is one of the first federal agencies to build internal design and development teams. The mission of the
Bureau is to ensure that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and
competitive, and we rely on intense collaboration between the technology team and our expert policy staff to
accomplish that mission. Financial products are increasingly technology-based, and having an in-house team of
designers and developers at the CFPB enables us to keep pace with today's market and develop new products that help
consumers succeed in their financial lives.

Our hope is that, by releasing as much of our code as possible [here on GitHub](http://github.com/cfpb), we can
encourage other federal agencies to lead more of their own design and development efforts and to share their work
with the world. We also hope to learn from and share with individuals across the country (or even the world), in
the true spirit of open source software development. We've already accepted
[a pull request from a member of the public](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/hack-the-government).

From time to time, we'll also discuss this work on [consumerfinance.gov](http://www.consumerfinance.gov), but here
you'll find more detail about choices, processes, and techniques. Our culture emphasizes creativity, innovation,
excellence, public service, respect, and openness. We are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and we build
world-class technology products for the American people. We look forward to sharing our work with you.
