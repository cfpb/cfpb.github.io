We’re excited to announce applications are now being accepted for the next round of
[CFPB Technology & Innovation Fellows](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/jobs/technology-innovation-fellows/). The fellowship is a two year program for software developers,
graphic and user experience (UX) designers, data specialists,
and cybersecurity professionals interested in leveraging technology to help
further our mission of making financial products and services work for consumers.

We’re looking for talented individuals with diverse backgrounds who embrace our mission
and are excited about building technology and helping to build our organization.
We expect the next group of fellows to begin work in January 2015.

Since the program launched two years ago, fellows have been hard at work applying their talents
to build amazing things to help financial products and services work for consumers.
Today, I’m proud to share with you some of their work.

Fellows have been instrumental in creating and building:

- [An easy-to use online tool to visualize and track public mortgage data](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/)
- [Ask CFPB](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/),
  an interactive tool that includes over 1,000 frequently-asked questions and answers
  to help consumers  find clear, unbiased answers to their financial questions
  ([also available in Spanish](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/es/))
- [eRegulations](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/),
  a tool that makes regulations easier to use by parsing public regulations,
  and then presenting the information in a format that’s
  easier to read, navigate, and understand
- Consumer-friendly design that is being incorporated in all facets of our work,
  such as forms that consumers use for
  [submitting complaints](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/),
  the [college cost shopping sheet](http://collegecost.ed.gov/shopping_sheet.pdf)
  and [student debt repayment tool](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/paying-for-college/repay-student-debt/),
  or our public reports.

Looking ahead, the next round of fellows will continue to build on these accomplishments
as well as tackle new projects in areas such as building software for our website,
developing consumer-friendly tools and materials, and supporting agency cybersecurity functions.

Technology and innovation are fundamental to our ability to achieve our consumer protection mission.
