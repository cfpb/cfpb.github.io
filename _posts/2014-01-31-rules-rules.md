Congress conveys its general vision by enacting laws; regulatory bodies, like the CFPB, implement that vision by publishing detailed regulations. These regulations are usually long, monolithic, difficult-to-read documents buried deep within Federal agency websites. With the recently released [eRegulations project](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations) ([source code](http://eregs.github.io/eregulations)), we aimed to make regulations more approachable by presenting them with structure and layers of relevant material. One of the core contributions of the project is a plain-text parser for these regulations, a.k.a. "rules." This parser pulls structure from the documents such that each paragraph can be properly indexed; it discovers citations between the paragraphs and to external works; it determines definitions; it even calculates differences between versions of the regulation. Due to the sensitive (and authoritative) nature of regulations, we cannot leave room for probabilistic methods employed via machine learning. Instead we retrieve all of the information through parsing, a rule-based approach to natural language processing.

In this article, we'll touch on a few of the tools we use when parsing regulations.

## XML: So much structure, so little meaning

The Government Printing Office publishes regulations in the [Code of Federal Regulations](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionCfr.action?collectionCode=CFR) (CFR) as XML bulk [downloads](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/CFR). Surely, with a structured language such as XML defining a regulation, we don't have much to do, right? Unfortunately, as Cornell [discovered](http://www.hklii.hk/conference/paper/2B3.pdf), not all XML documents are created equal, and the CFR's data isn't exactly clean. The Cornell analysis cites major issues with both inconsistent markup and, more insidiously, structure-without-meaning. Referring to the documents as a "bag of tags" conveys the problem well; just because a document has formatting does not mean it follows a logical structure. The XML provided in these bulk downloads was designed for conveying format, rather than structure, meaning header tags might be used to center text and italic paragraphs might imply headings.

In our efforts towards a minimum-viable-product, we chose to skip both the potential hints and pitfalls of XML parsing in favor of plain-text versions of the regulations. Our current development relies more heavily on XML, yet we continue to use plain text in many of our features, as it's easier to reason about. For the sake of simplicity, this writeup will proceed with the assumption that the regulation is provided as a plain-text document.

## Regular expressions: Regexi?

Regular expressions are one of the building blocks of almost any text parser. While we won't discuss them in great detail (there are many, better resources available), I will note that learning how to write simple regexes doesn't take much time at all. As you progress and want to match more and more, Google around: due to their widespread use, it's basically guaranteed that someone's had the same problem.

Regular expressions allow you to describe the "shape" of text you would like to match. For example, if a sentence has the phrase "the term", followed by some text, followed by "means" we might assume that that sentence is defining a word or phrase. Regexes give us many tools to narrow down the shape of acceptable text, including special characters to indicate whitespace, the beginning and end of a line, and "word boundaries" like commas, spaces, etc.

```python
"the term .* means"    # likely indicates a defined term
"\ba\b"                # only matches the word "a"; doesn't match "a" inside another word such as "bad"
```

Regexes also let us *retrieve* matching text. In our example above, we could determine not only that a defined term was likely present but also what that term or phrase would be. Expressions may include multiple segments of retrieved text (known as "capture groups"), and advanced tools will provide deeper inspection such as segmenting out repeated expressions.

```python
"Appendix ([A-Z]\d*) to Part (\d+)"
# Allows us to retrieve 'A6' and '2345' from "Appendix A6 to Part 2345"
```

Regular expressions serve as both a low-ish level tool for parsing and as a building block on which almost all parsing libraries are constructed. Understanding them will help you debug problems with higher-level tools as well as know their fundamental limitations.

## When is an (i) not an (i)?

Regulations generally follow a relatively strict hierarchy, where sections are broken into many levels of paragraphs and sub-paragraphs. The levels begin with the lower-case alphabet, then arabic numerals, followed by roman numerals, the upper-case alphabet, and then italic versions of many of these. Paragraphs each have a "marker", indicating where the paragraph begins and giving it a reference, but these markers may not always be at the beginning of a line. This means that, to find paragraphs, we'll need to search for markers *throughout* every line of text.

It's not a simple matter of starting a new paragraph whenever a marker is found, however. Paragraph markers are also sprinkled throughout the regulation inside citations to *other* paragraphs (e.g. `See paragraph (b)(4)`). To solve this issue, we can run a citation parser (touched on shortly) to find the citations within a text and ignore paragraph markers found within them.

There's also a pesky matter of ambiguity. Many of the roman numerals are identical (in appearance) to members of the lower-case alphabet. Further, when using plain text as a source, all italics are lost, so the deepest layers of the paragraph tree are indistinguishable from their parents. Luckily, we can both keep track of what we have seen before (i.e. what *could* the next marker be) as well as peek forward to see which marker follows. If a (i)-marker is followed by a (ii) or a (j), we can deduce exactly to which level in the tree the (i) corresponds.

## Parser combinators: Not as scary as they sound

Regular expressions certainly require additional mental overhead by future developers, who will generally "run" expressions in their mind to see what they do. Well-named expressions help a bit, but the syntax for naming capture groups in generally quite ugly. Further, combining expressions is error-prone and leads to even more indecipherable code. So-called "parser combinators" (i.e. parsers that can be combined) resolve or at least alleviate both of these issues. Combinators allow expressions to be named and easily combined to build larger expressions. Below, examples demonstrate these features using `pyparsing`, a parser combinator library for Python.

```python
part = Word(digits).setResultsName("part")
section = Word(digits).setResultsName("section")
part_section = part + "." + section

parsed = part_section.parseString("1234.56")
assert(parsed.part == "1234")
assert(parsed.section == "56")
```

Parser combinators allow us to match relatively sophisticated citations, such as phrases which include multiple references separated by conjunction text. The parameter `listAllMatches` tells pyparsing to "collect" all the phrases which match our request. In this case, that means we can handle each citation by walking through the list.

```python
citations = (
    citation.copy().setResultsName("head")
    + ZeroOrMore(conj_phrase
                 + citation.copy().setResultsName("tail",
                                                  listAllMatches=True)))

cits = citations.parseString("See paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (b)")
for cit in [citations.head] + citations.tail:
    handleCitation(cit)
```

## What about meaning?

Thus far, we have matched text, searched for markers, and retrieved sophisticated values out of the regulation. I can understand why this might feel like a bit of a letdown â€” the parser isn't doing any magic. It doesn't know what sentences mean; it simply knows how to find and retrieve specific *kinds* of substrings. While we could argue that this is a foundation of understanding, let's do something fun instead.

The problem we face is that we must determine what has changed when a regulation is modified. Modifications don't result in new versions of the regulaton from the Government Printing Office (which only publishes entire regulations once a year). Instead, we must look at the "notice" that modifies the regulation (effectively a diff). Unfortunately, the pin-point accuracy that we need appears only in English phrases like:

    4. Section 1005.32 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (c)(3), adding paragraph (b)(3), revising paragraph (c)(4) and removing paragraph (c)(5) to read as follows

We can certainly parse out some of the citations, but we won't understand what's happening to the text with these citations alone. To aid our efforts, let's focus on the parts of this sentence that we care about. Notably, we only really care about citations and verbs ("revising", "adding", "removing"). Citations will play both the roles of context and nouns (i.e. what's being modified). We can reduce the sentence into a sequence of "tokens", in this case becoming:

    [Citation, Verb, Citation, Citation, Verb, Citation, Verb, Citation, Verb, Citation]

Each Citation token will know its (partial) citation (e.g. paragraph (b)(3) with no section), while each Verb will know what action is being performed as well as the active/passive voice ("revising" vs. "revised").

We next convert all passive verbs into their corresponding active form by changing the order of the tokens. For example, "paragraph (b) is revised" gets converted into "revising paragraph (b)" in token form. Next, we can carry citation information from left to right. In this sentence, "Section 1005.32" carries context to each of the other paragraphs, filling in their partial citation information.

Finally, we can step through our list of tokens, keeping track of which modification mode we are in. We'd see "Section 1005.32" first, but since we start with no verb/mode set, we will ignore it. We then see "revising" and set our modification mode correspondingly. We can therefore mark each of the next two citations as "modified". We then hit an "adding" verb, so we switch modes and mark the following citation as "added". We continue this way, switching modes and marking citations until the whole sentence is parsed.

    [Citation[No Verb], Verb == revise, Citation[Revise], Citation[Revise], Verb == add, Citation[Add], Verb == revise ...

## Rules and anarchy

With combinations of just these tools, we can parse a great deal of content out of plain text regulations, including their structure, citations, definitions, diffs, and much more. What we've created has a great many limitations, however. The rule-based approach requires our developers think up "laws" for the English language, an approach which has proven itself ineffective in larger projects. Natural language is, in many ways, chaos, where machine learning and statistical techniques shine. In that realm, there is an expectation of inaccuracy simply because the problem is *so big*.

Fortunately, our task was not so large. The rule-based tools described above are effective with our limited set of examples (a subset of our own regulations). While the probabilistic techniques have, on average, higher accuracy for the general use case, they would not be as accurate as our tailored rules for our use cases. Striking the balance between rules and anarchy is difficult, but in this particular project, I believe we have chosen well.
