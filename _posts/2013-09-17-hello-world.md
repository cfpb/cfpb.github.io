title: Introducing cfpb.github.io
---



**TO DO:** Reframe to lead with _principles_, then describe the _team_.



Welcome to **cfpb.github.io**, the new home on the web for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to
display and discuss the work being done in its Office of Technology and Innovation.

The CFPB is one of the first federal agencies to build internal design and development teams. The mission of the
CFPB is to make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americans, and we rely on intense
collaboration between the technology team and our expert staff to accomplish that mission. Financial products are
increasingly technology-based, and having an in-house team of designers and developers enables us to keep pace with
today's market and develop new products of our own that help our fellow Americans succeed in their financial lives.

Having just been established in 2010, the CFPB has had the unique opportunity to create a technology team from
scratch, built on the latest and greatest best practices in design and development. We are strong proponents of
open source software, both the use of it in our organization and the releasing of our own.

Our hope is that, by releasing as much of our code as possible [here on GitHub](http://github.com/cfpb), we can
encourage other federal agencies to also engage in internal development and the sharing of their work with the
world. We also hope to foster collaboration with individuals across the country (or even the world), in the true
spirit of the open source software community. We've even already accepted
[a pull request from a member of the public](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/hack-the-government).

You can see more details about our philosophy on using and releasing open source software by reading our
[Source Code Policy](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/developers/sourcecodepolicy/).

Besides software development, this website will also feature the work of CFPB's Design Team, which comprises close
to two dozen graphic and user experience designers. We'll talk about our design process and the value of design in
providing financial assistance to our fellow Americans. (Hint: good design is incredibly important when dealing
with a topic like finance, which comes with a great number of barriers to entry for the average consumer.)

We are the CFPB's Office of Technology and Innovation. We build world-class software products for the American
people, CFPB staff, and for each other. Our culture grows from ideas firmly rooted in creativity, innovation,
excellence, public service, respect, and openness. Each product we build expresses these virtues, and we look
forward to sharing our work with you.
