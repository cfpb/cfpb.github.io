# [cfpb.github.io](https://cfpb.github.io/)

A site for the CFPB to share and discuss its technology work with the world.

## Running it locally with Docker

Content editors and developers probably want to set up cfpb.github.io on
their local machine so they can preview updates without pushing to GitHub.

Before you get started, make sure you have an up-to-date version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed on your machine and that it is running.

[Fork and clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
to your local machine.

Using terminal, in the project directory, run:
```sh
docker-compose up
``` 

Open it up in your browser: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)


## Working with the front end

The cfpb.github.io project front end currently uses the following:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/): Static site generator used by GitHub Pages.
