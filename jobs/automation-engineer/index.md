Do you have a passion for using your stellar technical skills to help people
and improve government? Do you love to use technologies like Python,
Ansible, Puppet, and Docker to quickly build machines and environments
in the cloud that do amazing things? Do you love to ensure and measure
the reliability of production environments? Working at the [Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) (CFPB) could be for you!

## About the CFPB

The central mission of the CFPB is to make markets for consumer financial
products and services work for Americans, and to empower consumers to take
more control over their economic lives. Smart, usable, and reliable technology
is a key part of how we achieve our mission.

## Your impact

As a Back-end Developer (Automation Engineer) you will shepherd
unit/integration, browser, and load testing; continuous delivery; and monitoring.
They rely on Jenkins, TravisCI, Selenium WebDriver, Python/Behave/Gherkin,
SauceLabs, and JMeter, and are eager to expand their toolkit.

## What you'll get

- The opportunity to deliver software that affects the day-to-day lives of millions of American families
- The chance to work with top-notch colleagues on the Design and Development Team and across the rest of the Bureau

## What we're looking for

We’re looking for people who are curious, bring diverse backgrounds
and perspectives, can communicate well with non-technical individuals,
and are passionate about solving complex problems in technology and policy.
We are looking for highly skilled, creative individuals that love
building innovative software solutions and are eager to serve the American public.

The ideal candidate should demonstrate hands-on experience designing and
developing high-traffic web products and software applications in an Agile
environment, using languages such as JavaScript, or Python and overseeing the
standards for creating Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). A proven
track record of delivering significant results as part of a team and handling
multiple competing priorities is a must.
